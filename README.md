# ore-magic-youtube

Make it easy to get youtube video urls for me lazy

## start
```
$ docker-compose up
```

## input youtube URL
at http://localhost:10080/magic and submit

## get video
If you can get the streaming URL, a button with iTag (like video quality) number will be displayed.
The chrome video player will start and you can download it from the button at the bottom right.
If you don't have a numbered button, do your best manually.
